## Technology Stack

VTumpang is developed using the Flutter framework, making it compatible with both Android and iOS devices. The app also utilizes Google Maps for navigation and Firebase for data storage and messaging.

## Usage

Once registered, users can either create a carpool or join an existing one. To create a carpool, the driver selects their destination and desired departure time, and the app matches them with any passengers who have requested a ride in the same direction. Passengers can also request a ride by selecting a trip from the available list or creating a custom carpool request. Drivers can accept or decline custom carpool requests from passengers. Before and during the journey, both drivers and passengers can communicate with each other using the in-app messaging feature. After the journey, both parties can rate and review each other to maintain the quality of the carpooling community.

Users can track their carpooling activity, view trip history, and earn rewards based on their participation. The app provides real-time navigation using Google Maps for a seamless carpooling experience. Users can also view their earned rewards, redeem them for available rewards, and track their redemption history.
