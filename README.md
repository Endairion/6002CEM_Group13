## Technology Stack
VTumpang is developed using the Flutter framework, making it compatible with both Android and iOS devices. The app also utilizes Google Maps for navigation and Firebase for data storage and messaging.

## Usage
Once registered, users can either create a carpool or join an existing one. To create a carpool, the driver selects their destination and the app matches them with any passengers who have requested a ride in the same direction. Passengers can also request a ride by selecting their destination and waiting for the app to match them with a driver. Before and during the journey, both drivers and passengers can communicate with each other using the in-app messaging feature. After the journey, both parties can rate and review each other to maintain the quality of the carpooling community.
